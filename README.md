# COP (Predict colonization outcomes for complex microbial communities)

This is a Pytorch and Sklearn implementation of COP, as described in our paper:

Predict colonization outcomes for complex microbial communities.

## This repository contains:
(1) Synthetic dataset to test the COP (classification and regression) generated by gLV population dyanmics.

(2) R codes to generated synthetic dataset.

(3) Python codes of NODE (Pytorch) and other two COP methods (Sklearn).

(4) Python code to calcualte colonization impact.
